/* jsProcessor.py */

This little script packs together and compresses a list of js files. For more information see settings.xml

Works on Windows and Macs etc

Dependencies:

- JAVA (for the closure compiler)
- Python (for the python script!)

At least the JAVA path should be in your environment variables

1. change the settings in your xml file

2. run from command line:
python jsProcessor.py 'settings.xml'


/* jsProcessor.php */

Kinda the same but just with php. Uses Douglas Crockford's (old PHP minifier)
Fire up a local PHP server and just head to the page in your browser
